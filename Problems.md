There should not occur any problems due to my testing.<br>
That is except for when the user quits the program.<br>

This will generate a image and a file.<br>

Now if the user did wait for lets say 4500 days in game time.<br>
the programm will(probably) throw a OutOfMemory Exception.<br>

I also had another exception while generating the image.<br>
This would then be a array out of bounds exception I believe.<br>
It occurs if a stocks value is rising to imense heights.<br>
Which to be fair, rarely will happen.<br>
