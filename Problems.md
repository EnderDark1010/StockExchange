There should not occur any problems due to my testing.<br>
That is except for when the user quits the program.<br>

This will generate a image and a file.

Now if the user did wait for lets say 4500 days in game time.
the programm will(probably) throw a OutOfMemory Exception.

I also had another exception while generating the image.
This would then be a array out of bounds exception I believe.
It occurs if a stocks value is rising to imense heights.
Which to be fair, rarely will happen.
